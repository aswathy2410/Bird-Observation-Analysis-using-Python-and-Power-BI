The project aims to analyse the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems:
forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations across these habitats, the goal is to
understand how environmental factors, such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain, influence bird
populations and their behaviour. The study will involve working on the provided observational data of bird
species present in both ecosystems, identifying patterns of habitat preference, and assessing the impact
of these habitats on bird diversity. The findings can provide valuable insights into habitat conservation,
biodiversity management, and the effects of environmental changes on avian communities.
